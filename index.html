    <h2>SHS TIMES</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The accomplishment I am most proud of is SHS TIMES - A subscription based digital newspaper - because of which I got an opportunity to understand business out of the textbooks. It made me more responsible, helped improve my communication and leadership skills, taught me team work and the value of money. this initiative aimed at providing information to parents as well as providing the students of our school freedom of speech, the ability to raise their concerns also recognising their talents by featuring their work. SHS TIMES truned out to be successful because of the support it received and was able to generate ₹1 lakh of profit as it started with zero investment being a digital newspaper. I started it all by myself; now it is a team of 15 students who I mentor as the editor.</p>

    <h2>THRIFT STORE</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I have always been so passionate about fashion ​that I dream of starting my own sustainable fast ​fashion brand someday. For our school's annual ​fest, to promote sustainable fashion, I partnered ​with a friend to convert our classroom into a thrift ​store where we traded good-quality used ​clothes. We lead the team of our classmates who ​worked in different departments and helped us ​to make this initiative successful and profitable as ​a business model and we were able to create ​awareness about sustainable fashion. The fast ​fashion industry generates a lot of waste ​annually. I hope to change that with a sustainable ​brand using only recycled materials to ​manufacture clothing and also make it more ​affordable so that consumers don’t have to think ​twice before choosing sustainability.

    <h2>SEAL TANK</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>With the 100,000 rupees that SHS TIMES was able to generate, I ​had an idea, because shs times was the first and the only business ​in our school I  invested that money in other business ideas by 11th ​graders because I learned so much through starting my own ​business I wanted them to have this opportunity as well. With my ​other batchmates we organised an event called the “Seal tank” ​similar to shark tank but instead of criticism the idea was to nurture ​the ideas. I mentored 3 finalists to improve their pitch teach them ​about business and help them through my experience. ₹45,000 ​were invested in 2 ideas which promoted a business culture in our ​school and also thought the students how to get investment for ​your business ideas.</p>

    <h2>Oxford Summer Program</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The school sponsored mel to attend a summer program. I got an opportunity ​to attend the Oxford summer program for business and entrepreneurship. It ​was a wonderful experience I learned a lot of business administration but ​most of I got an incredible experience because the learning style in UK is very ​different from India. The learning style there is more practical I got to ​understand some concepts through different experiences for example to ​learn negotiation the professor actually asked us to negotiate with each other ​and that is how I know everything about principles of negotiation. The course ​was not just about academics but also about meeting people from across the ​world understanding their cultures, exchanging ideas, learning about different ​prospectives. Apart from the course this was my first sole trip. Travelling alone ​across the world made me more responsible, active but mostly grateful. ​During the course I was able to improve as a person because lived by myself ​in my dorm which meant I had to do my own laundry, wake up on time and ​arrange my own meals and manage my expenses within the budget because ​of this I am able to manage my time better and be a bit more self-reliant. I also ​met with some amazing people was able to make friends from different parts ​of the world. Overall it was an enriching experience. I also received an ​amazing letter of recommendation from my professor.</p>
